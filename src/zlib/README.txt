It's source code of zlib library
home page: https://zlib.net/

Note, I did not wrtie any code, it's included just
to made code compailing easier, to have all used 
files in one place

Note, I may accidently lightly modifaied some lines 
of it, while was browrsing it and looking for needed 
functions, I mean I could have pressed enter of 
something, so the raw files content may not match 
originals...
